## Lessons

Unit 3 has five lessons:

1.  [Plotting Raw Data](03-VizWhiz-1.qmd)
2.  [Boxes, Violins, and Histograms](03-VizWhiz-2.qmd)
3.  [Bars, Columns, and Scatterplots](03-VizWhiz-3.qmd)
4.  [Customising Plots](03-VizWhiz-4.qmd)
5.  [GIFS! A VizW(h)iz Bonus Lesson](03-VizWhiz-5.qmd)

::: callout-tip
This unit gives you a taste of the kinds of plots you can build with `ggplot`. The [R Graph Gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/) is a really great resource for working out which kind of plot can best tell your data story.

## Why "VizW(h)iz"?

R-Ladies Sydney co-founders Lisa Williams and Jen Richmond, who conjured up the name of this unit, had different things in mind! Lisa had in mind "VizWiz" - as in Visualisation Wizardry! Jen had in mind "VizWhiz" - as in Becoming a Whiz in Visualisation!

It turns out this debate cannot be won (or lost). True, wizards are classically male - though we're all about busting stereotypes at R-Ladies Sydney! Also true - while it's great to be a whiz at something, we all know by know learning R isn't such a speedy undertaking!

To bridge this great divide, we find ourselves with a compromise: VizW(h)iz!!

Lets start by [plotting raw data](03-VizWhiz-1.qmd)
