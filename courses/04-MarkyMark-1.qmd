# Formatting in R Markdown

Now that you have loaded your data into R, cleaned it up, and made some impressive looking plots, you probably want to show your analysis to someone else, who may or may not be an R user. R Markdown is a really easy way of creating analysis reports to share with others. It is also a useful tool for making sure that the analysis you do is well-documented and reproducible; use R Markdown and your future self will thank you.
